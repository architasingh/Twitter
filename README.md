# Project 2 - *Twitter*

**Twitter** is a basic twitter app to read and compose tweets the [Twitter API](https://apps.twitter.com/).

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **core** features are completed:

**A user should**

- See an app icon in the home screen and a styled launch screen
- Be able to log in using their Twitter account
- See at latest the latest 20 tweets for a Twitter account in a Table View
- Be able to refresh data by pulling down on the Table View
- Be able to like and retweet from their Timeline view
- Only be able to access content if logged in
- Each tweet should display user profile picture, username, screen name, tweet text, timestamp, as well as buttons and labels for favorite, reply, and retweet counts.
- Compose and post a tweet from a Compose Tweet view, launched from a Compose button on the Nav bar.
- See Tweet details in a Details view
- App should render consistently all views and subviews in recent iPhone models and all orientations

The following **stretch** features are implemented:

**A user could**

- Be able to **unlike** or **un-retweet** by tapping a liked or retweeted Tweet button, respectively. (Doing so will decrement the count for each)

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Working with delegates
2. Best ways to go about doing constraints

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

The auto-layout portion was difficult because it took time getting used to creating constraints and formatting the content in the desired format.
